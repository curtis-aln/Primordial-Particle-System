## Introduction
> https://www.nature.com/articles/srep37969
Self-structuring patterns are prevalent throughout the universe, from galaxies to molecules to living organisms. Despite their ubiquity, the mechanisms driving their emergence remain a subject of extensive research. Our project, the Primordial Particle System (PPS), seeks to illuminate these mechanisms by modeling a simple yet profound motion law for self-propelled particles. This system exhibits self-structuring, self-reproducing, and self-sustaining behaviors that resemble life-like phenomena observed in nature.

The PPS models particles that move and interact according to a straightforward set of rules, leading to the spontaneous formation of complex, life-like structures. These emergent patterns mirror those found in living organisms, including distinct life cycles, growth, reproduction, and interaction within an evolving ecosystem. By analyzing both the macroscopic properties of this emerging ecology and the microscopic mechanics behind it, we explore how simple motion rules can generate intricate structures and behaviors.

Key aspects of the PPS include:
- **Emergent Structures:** The system produces cell-like structures with distinct life cycles, demonstrating self-organization and self-reproduction without global information.
- **Macroscopic and Microscopic Analysis:** We examine properties such as size distributions, longevity, and resilience against noise, alongside the fundamental mechanics driving these phenomena.
- **Parameter Exploration:** We investigate how varying parameters affect the system, aiming to understand potential candidates for life-like behavior across different scales.

The simplicity and generality of the motion law used in PPS suggest that a single fundamental rule could account for diverse self-structuring patterns observed in nature, from cosmic scales to subatomic formations. Our work offers insights into how fundamental principles might underpin the emergence of complex systems across various scales, providing a valuable perspective on the nature of self-organization and life-like behavior.

Through this project, we contribute to a deeper understanding of how simple, local interactions can lead to sophisticated, global behaviors, potentially offering new avenues for designing artificial active matter systems and exploring fundamental questions about life and complexity.
